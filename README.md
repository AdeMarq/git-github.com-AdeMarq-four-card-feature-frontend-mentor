### Links

- Live Site URL: [http://127.0.0.1:5500/]

## My process
- created a container from the body
- created three column wrapped in a container
- gave each box a class to help target the individual border-top colors
- downloaded the font size and weight required for the tags (p, h4, h2)

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first 
- CSS - For styles



### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I look forward to trying other challenges which would help impve my CSS skills towards becoming a great front-end developer.
